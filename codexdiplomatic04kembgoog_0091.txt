am satisfied that this view is the correct oue, with
perhaps the exception 01 the word supersederi ‚· for 1
know of no evidence that we ever had the imperial
indictione. Ι can give an example from the close of
the eighth century crucial enough to put the question
beyond any doubt. A charter osona in this collec-
tion bears date n.n.781. Ind.1v. Natale Sci. Ste-
phani Martyria, i. e. December 2611. Now as Decem-
ber 26111 is the second day 01 the year 781, and as the
Caesarean indiction commences long after tbe auth
of December, 781, viz. September 24th,781, it is clear
that the aoth of December, 781, falls in the third,
not the fourth Caesarean indiction3 or that the aoth
of December in the fourth indiction falls in the year
782. If, on the other hand, both year and indiction
commenced on the aoth of December, the dates ara
perfectly reconciled. With the result thus ascer-
tained, ninety-nine in every hundred of these docu-
ments are found to coincide. ’κ’
But I am inclined to carry the use of the Pontifical
indictions to a much earlier period3 in short, 10
prove that Beda himself knew 01 no others, iu spite
01 the statement made by himself that the indictions
commenced 11102411 of September. The Council of
Haethfield is allowed 10 have been holdeu on the xv
kal. October, 680: Beda however says aab die quinta·
decimo Kalendas Octobres, indictione 001000. Now
if Beda meant the Cesaraean indiction, the eighth of
which commenced the alth of September, 680, 11 is
clear that the l7th of September in the' eighth indic-
tion could only fall in 681: but as tho year 01 the
incarnation in which this council was holden is fixed
beyond possibility 01 doubt, it is clear that Beda
intends the Pontifical indiction, ascertained accord·
ing to his own rulo by adding three to the number of
the year and dividing by fifteen, the year and indic·
