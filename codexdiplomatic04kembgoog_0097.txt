except Northumberland, should have been forged
upon a salse basis laid by Nortbumbrian monis,
when they must be in positive contradiction to the
chroniclers followed by the very persons who must
have lorged theml Is it conceivablo that clergymen
in Canterbury, winchester, or Worcester, if they sat
down to forge a charter, should have inserted in it a
date which they themselves believed to be a false
one, because one differing from the records kept in
their own monasterieS, one too whose startling and

king in the sanie year. No. 237 is a grant made in
835 by the same Ecgberht, and confirmed by him in
the thirty-fourth year of his reign; that is according
