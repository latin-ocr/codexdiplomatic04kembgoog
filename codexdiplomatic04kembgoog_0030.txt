Sometimes both proem and movent clause appear
to coalesce; in other words the movent clause takes
placeas the proem itsell In this case there is no
Quamobrem, Quapropter, or Iyitur, but the name of

the granter follows immediately upon the invocation.

1. Iu nomine domini dei nostri Ihesu Christi!
Ego Uihtredus rex Cantuariorum, prouidens mihi in

Many charters of Offa, nglaf, Berhtwulf and
AEnelwulf are drawn up in this form. It is hardly
necessary to observo that such clauses are entirely
independent of any one reciting a consideration ior

apparently in the hope of giving greater validity and
permanence to the transaction: although there is no
evidence os the existence, in these times, of any
law which made grants without consideration void.
Finally, it may be observed that most Anglosaxon
charters have both invocation and proem3 that some
have an invocation and no proem; others on the
contrary a proem and no invocation. A sew genuine

charters have neither the one nor the other; but the
