to speak of knights fees and the like at a time when
there was really no 'infeudation3 at 'a time in short
when the possession was absolute, and when, is one
could use such terms' at all, every such landowner
was seized in see, and not in his demesne as of ¹lee.
ί The 'service was incident to the possession of land;
the land was not held upon condition ot' doing the
service3 for not doing it he no doubt was liable to
punishment,'hut not necessarily 'to 'forfeiturez and
the consequences of lealty, as far at least as the
land is concerned, are wanting.

Another burthen which sell upon the land is the
pastus repis, a right to send a certain number of head·
of cattle to pastore in the common lands of a par-v
ticular district; and it is one of the most important,
because one of the first, in the long series ol usurpa-'
tions by which the free landowners of the pau were
ousted of their essential privileges. As iar as the
eommons were concerned 'it appears srorn the ex-
amples already given that this right of common was
transferable, and matter os grant But by the same
term we also understand a contributiou due from
certain lands to the lring on various occasions, as· on
journeyS, etc. and in this sense it seems equivalent
to the procuratio of the ecclesiastical law. Although
monasteries and other corporations were principally
subject to this burthen, yet there is no reason for
doubting that it pressed upon lay lands also; and
srom the analogy of the German customs we may
presume that only lreemen were subject to it and
similar exactione. The bond, who could nothe
supposed to have any interest or estate in the lands ’
on which they were located, probably escaped it·
altogether¹⁴. ·
