to Florence, etc. confirmed in 834, the year before
it was granted3 but according to Simeon confirmed
in 836, the year alter, which is more reasonable.

On the usual computetion Archbishop AEllelheard
died in 8033 and Wulfred succeeded him either 111
that year or the year following. No. 189 shows that
in the Archives of Canterbury there was a grant
made hy him in 804: while No. 190 10 011 original
grant made by him in 805, in which year, according
to the Chronicle of Mailros, etc. he died, and Wulfred
became archbishop. Nos. 1903191200 0116201 are
grants to which Wulfred was 0 party: in 011 01 these
he dates his praesulate from 805. ’

Agaim Florence and some MSS. of the Saxon
Chronicle place the death 01 0110 01 Μο1010 in 794,
and consequendy condemn the charter No. th‚ which
was signed hy him in 796. But Simeon, one MS. of
the Chronicle, Hoveden, the Chronicle 01 Μο11100,
Henry 01 Huntingdon, and the Welsh Annalists
place his death rightly in 796, thus confirming and
receiving confirmation from the charter3 while 01
least in a dozen 01 his granis, Odenwulf, the successor
01 Ecgfrili (Offa's son, who reigned only a few
weelrs), dates 11011796. 80 with Offe's accession,
and AEoelbald's death3 which the northems justly
place in 757, the southerns in 755, and which the
charters invariahly decide in favour 01 the former
date.

Ι1 we follow Florence and the Saxon Chroniole,
we must declaro a 01101101 01 Sigiraed‚ No. 114, to be
0 forgery; for it bears date 764, and yet is signed hy
Archbishop Bregowine, who according 10 those au·
thorities died in 762; while Iaenberht, who in the
charter signs as abbas, became erchbishop 111 the
same year. But Simeon places this prelete’s death
and Iaenberht's accession in 765.
