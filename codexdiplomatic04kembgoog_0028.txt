From these examplcs it appears that the distinctive
mark of the proem is its being followed by the words
Ergo, Idcirco, Ideo, Quamobrem, Quapropter, Pro
qua re, etc.

I do not perceive that any Anglosaxon king pecu-
liarly affected one form of proem, as is acknowledged
to have been the case among the Franks. Itis
impossible to mistalre the charter of a Meroving or
Carloving, from the strictness os style adopted by
them in their chancery. But in this respect, each.
English prince appears to have done what secmed
good in his own eyes3 or, to speak more strictly, the
form depended solely on the caprice of the person
who happened to draw up any particular instrument.
The Franks and Italians, having a class of officials,
to whom this duty was committed, more rarely varied
the words and torm os their instrumente.

It hasbeen said that the proem of an Anglosaxon
charter answers in spirit to the movent clause of a
Narman one; that is, it expresses iu general terms
the reason for granting the charter. It does not
however exclude the possibility of suche clause
being itself found in a subsequent member of the
charter, whether in general or special terms. As I
do not look upon these clauses as substantive and
necessary parts of a charter, afew instances only
need be given os them. ”
