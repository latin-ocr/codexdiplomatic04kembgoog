granta ior a longer term than the life of tha
grantee3 but this, which probably had never been
well observed, had fallen into utter desuetudo in the
tenth century. Towards its close, Bishop Oswald
of Worcester made a point of granting for three
lives, sometimes named in the instrument or indorsed
upon it. I subjoin one or two examples from his
charters which are drawn up in a torm rather less
varying in different cases, than those os other Anglo-

’ saxons3 so much so, indeed, as to make it probable

that this prelato kept blank forms by him, to bo
filled up as occasion might require.

A similar clause in a chomor of Oswald’s of 968,
has this note appended:

AElfward waes se forma man, and nd hit stent his
dohtor on hande, and hod is se ouer man, i. e. AElf-
ward was the first lise, and tho land is now in tho
hand oi his daughter. She is the second life.
