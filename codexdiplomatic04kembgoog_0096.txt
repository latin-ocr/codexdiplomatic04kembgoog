selves with the hints here thrown out by way ol'
caution. Ι have myself been compelled to investi-
gate every regnal year given in all these instruments3
and Ι therefore know how impossible it is, within
any reasonable limita, to do justice to the subject.
For this is not a question which can be dealt with in
generalities, hut each single date must he sisted,
investigated, and settled upon its own peculiar
grounds. My conclusione are embodied in the fasti
which are appended to this work.

A very important question arises at this point.
As the object in view is to test the chortem, it is
clear that we must have some starting point, some
roo στω without and independent of the charters

both the jear os Christ, the Indiction, and the

ness of the chronicles themselves, we are met hy an
unexpeoted difficulty. During long periods os yearS,
the Northern chroniclers differ from those os the
South and West hy two whole years in every date,
and this discrepancy cannot be explained by assum-
