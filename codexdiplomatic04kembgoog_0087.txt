that Augustino would introduce the Christian era,
and a posteriori that there is no evidence of his not
having done so, Ι feel justified in assuming that he
really did. And Iwill add one or two consideratione
which confirm mein my view. The great attention
paid by Beda to the calculation of times and sensons,
eras and dates, renders him a most important autho-
rity on all matters of this description. Now Beda
never insinuates that there was a time since the
introduction of Christianity in which the era of the
incarnation was unknown in England3 nor does he
mention, as 1 think he would with honour, the name
of the person to whom we should have owed so great
achange, and one so praiseworthy. In all his own
works hc uses it as a date perfectly familiar to his
readers3 and these works, be it remembered, were
written from the very commencement till the thirtieth
year of the eighth century, during which it is pre-
tended this date was first introduced. Again, the
era of the incarnation is found in those copies of
Gregory's letters which Nd’thelm obtained for Beda
from the papal regesta. Now either this existed in
the originale (which, from the loose way in which
the Registrum Gregoriannm was drawn up, on the
authority of which the contrary is argued, it would
he too much to deny,) or Beda himself supplied it.
If we admit the former supposition, the question is
settled. If the latter, we attribute to Beda the
useless labnnr of attempting to illustrate notum per
ignotius, a date that was, by a date that was not,
familiar.

Ι therefore repudiate in toto the preliminary objec-
tion to many an anthentic charter, viz. that it contains
the date of our Lord’s incarnation. But even snp-
posing that this constituted a valid objection to an
original charter, it can be none whatever to an
