short, snch marks may not have been held binding
among the Saxons even before the introduction of
Christianity. For the hammer of 'l'hunor (Thbrr)
was tbe true heathen symbol in all contracte, and it
is well known that the hammer of Thnnor was repre·
sented by across.

I now proceed to enter more in detail into the
nature of these signatnres. Ι have stated that the
persons who signed were the comites, companions
and councillors of the king3 that is both laios and
clergymen. That this was the case before Beda's
time we learn from bis letter to Ecgberht3 and mere
inspectior of the signatores attached to the following
charters will prove it still more clearly. In many of
them we are informed of the relation in which the
signer stood to the grantor; as frater et comes
praedicti regis3 filius regis3 regis parens (that is
relation, mag, one belonging to the parentela or
mdegburh); regis dapifer; regis pedissequus; regis
praepositus. Moreover in the later charters the rank

sol the witnesses is oarefully mentioned, as ego N
episeopus or abbas3 princeps3 dnx; minister or
miles3 presbyter or diaconus. In the earlier char-
ters, however, this is rarely the case, nor does there
appear to bc so strict an observanoe of precedency
as may be detected in the later instrumentum. From
the time of Olfa this becomes the foundation of an
