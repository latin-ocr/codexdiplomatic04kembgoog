Undoubtedly seven instances, sparely collected
from about a thousand instrumenta, make bnt a small
mass of evidence3 themora so as only one of the
whole seven is positivcly authentic and beyond sus-
picion. But this one is procf enough, and valuablc
from its great antiquity (a. 858); its existence is '

not found in the same collections, at least not by
name, and it is therefore desirahle to show that at

mans 1 cannot positivcly say; but evidence can be
given of granta by which the exemption from toll
was given, as well of grants which conferred the
right of levying it. The process was in either case
simple. Tolls upon water-transport (the only ones
