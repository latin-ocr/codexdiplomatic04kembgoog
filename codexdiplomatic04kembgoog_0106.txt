INTRODUOTION· XCV

interesting inquiry: the man who in one year signed
as simply miles or minister, is found a few years
later styling himself dux or princeps. Now this
appears to me to be explained by the circumstance
that a certain amount of land was necessary to
certain rank, and that the promotior of these nobles
’ in the scale was merely the consequence of their
having in the interim found means to increase their
possessione.

In the earliest of these documents the form of
subscription is simple: it consists merely of the
cross followed by the words signnm manus N orM.
A little later we find Ego N consensi et subscripsi.
But towards the beginning of the tenth century a
great change was introduced, corresponding to that
which we have ohserved respecting the proem and
sanction. The witnesses now vie with one another
in the absurdity of their subscriptions; they seem to
have thought it a mark of learning and talant to
vary these in such a manner as thot no one should
sign in the exact words introduced by another.
And this is so demolire a mark of the charters
of this period, that it forms one of the strongest
evidentes of forgery when found in charters profess·
ing an earlier date. 'l'he charters of Peterborough
are proved forgeries hy this, even were there no
other evidences3 and the train of argument which
arose from this consideration first led me to look for
