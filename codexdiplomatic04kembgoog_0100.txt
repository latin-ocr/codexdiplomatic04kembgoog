date having been partially ahraded hy age, and so
misread: the want of a light line at the hottom
readily transsorms a v (in the old chartcrs ιι) into a
113 an abrasion may convert an x into a v: hence
we not uncommonly find in these copies indiction
ιιιι for vrr or xv; vrr for x113 xrr for xv, andthe
like. Nor is another error at all uncommon, where
a letter οι contractiori has been taken to be part of

taken to represent three units. This cause of error

unnecessary.

But even the carelessness os a scribe may have

genuine charter of Offa in this collection, No. 138,
bears 'date nocxxrr, twenty-seven years before that
prince came to the throne: fortunately several
ancient copies exist with the right date, nconxxx,
showing that an n had been lest out hy accident.
Many of these documenta have no dates at all; the
means by which we then approximate to their real
date will he considered under our next head-the

But before Ι leave the question oi dates, Ι wish ιο

of the Dancs in Thenet, eto. etc. All such introduc-
tions seem to me suspicions, and to he prima facie
evidence of a fraudulent intention3 and this, because
as the truth always feels itself to he strong, hut a
lie always icels itself ιο he wealr, the great pains
taken to make us believe something, lead us natu-
