riorum, if ever there were such apamen, is known to
us from these charters alone; and so little known to
us from them, that the compilor of the chartulary in

which they are found, confounds him with St. Oswine
of Nortbumberland, and notes discrepancies in the
dates upon that supposition. Suaebhard, rex Can-
tuariorum, is mentioned as an intruder by various

associated with him in the government.

Various Kings appear tc have used various titles
in proportion as they extended their power and
influence. Aethilbald styles himself sometimes King
of tbe Marciana, sometimes of the Angles, sometimes
