Perhaps however the most valuable and interest·
ing of all the documents contained in this collection
are the Wills. of their importance us philological
monuments I have spoken already, and shall make
bnt one remark on this3 viz. that the great antiquity
aud peculiarities of the language in which they are
sor the most part written, is os itsels a decislve
guarantee of their authenticity. This is in itselse
proof, uushakeable, irrefragable, far beyond any
evidence we can offer for any other class ol docu-
ments3 and fortunately supplied in the very case
where almost ell other evidence lails us: for these
documents being for the most part directions, to
have effect upon a contingency, and the directions
os private individuale of no green note or name,
without dates or' such formalities of signatore us
accompany the Latin chartus, supply few tests of
authenticity.

These documents, from their very nature, furuish
a green deal of valuable informatiou which would
otherwise have been altogether lost to us3 and on
this account I trust Ι shall be excused for ocenpying

some little space in their investigation, reserving the
full examination of their bearing for a work sormally
devoted to the “ Law of the Anglosaxous.'' The

earliest genuine will in this collection is of the ninth
ᾧ century3 but it by no means follows that there were
not such instrumente at periods far more remote.
- Every thing renders it probable that the custom of
making devises of lands us well as chattels was
introduced from Rome by Augustine. Still, from

' the evidence of the wills before us, we should be

inclined to argue that they were uot looked upon in
so solemn a light as the charters: there is a want of
formality about them which is very easily under·
stood, but which still seems to lead to the conclusion
