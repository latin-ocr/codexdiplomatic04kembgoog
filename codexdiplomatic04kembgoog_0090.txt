Indictio, sume annos Domini, et adjice tria, partire '
per xv. et quod remanserit ipsa est Indictio anni
praesentis. ’

Now it is obvious that the source of an important
error lies in these words3 for if the indiction com-
mences on the 24111 01 September, and the birth of
oi1r Lord fell on the aoth 01 December in the fourth
indiction, it is clear that nine months only 01 the
first year 01 our Lord sell in the sonrth, and three in
the fifth indiction, and so on to all eternity: in other
worda, that each year of our Lord falls partly in two
indictions, and each indiction in two years. For
instance, in 1839, the twelfth indiction commences
September 24111, and ends September 23111, 18401 01
again, from December 25111, 1839, 10 September 14111,
1839, falls in the eleventh indiction, while from Sep·
tomher 24111, laetato December 24111, 1839, falls in tho
twelfth¹⁷. But this distinction appears srom the “

very earliest times to have been neglected‚ and the · Α

simple rulo adopted of adding three to the year os
Christ, and dividing by fifteen to find the indiction
1011110 whole year; thus neglecting the fraction, and
taking 101 granted that the indiction and the year
commenccd and terminated on the¹ same day. This
”was known hythe name 01 the Pontifical, to distin·
gnish it srom the Caesarean or Imperial indiction,
which commenccd on tho aith 01 September. I
believe it is now admitted that in the course 01 the
eighth century the Pontifical had superseded the
Imperial indictione in England: and Pagi, the learned ,
commentator on Baronius, asseris this distinctly. 1

¹⁷ 1111 to be borne in mind year. Hence every year 01 Christ,
that the 25111 01 December is the according to the Anglosaxon reck-
first, and the alth 01 December caing falls in two years according
the last day oi the Anglosaxon to 01111,ωὰ110010110.
