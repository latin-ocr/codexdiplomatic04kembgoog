their kingdom lasted. Those of Eustanglia, probably

Reges Eastanglorum, Orientalium anglorum, or
merely Anglorum. The relations however of these
kings is throughout obscure3 and history has little
recorded of them, from the murder of Aedilberht, till
the defeat and death of Ehdmund3 after whose fall
Eastanglia never recovered its independence, being
held as a kind of province hy the Danish invaders,
or finally incorporated in the dominions of Wessex.
From all that has preceded it naturally follows
r that we cannot look upon the presence or absence of
any particular title, as a safe criterion of the authen-
ticity of a document; one of the many circumstances
in which the charters of the Anglosaxon differ from
those of the Norman kings, and which is referable to
the same caus'e, viz. the absence of a Chaucery and
distinct body of professional clerks or notarios.
Unquestionably, grave errors of fact, as where a
king of Kent should be made to call himself king of
Essex, and the like, are matter of suspicion: but
even here some discretionis necessary, and errors of
this grave nature, when occurring in charters not
professing to be originale, must be treated with
lenity: they are very osten merely the interpolations
of late and ill informed transcribere. For example,
, in a grant to Worcester made before 709, offa is
called rex Marciorum, and this error pervades all
the copies we possess of the document, But it
appears to me that it is not of itself sufficient to
invalidate the charter. The signatures of the wit-
nesses prove distinctly that the grantor was Offa of
Essex, not of Mareia, who did not come to the
throne till fifty years later. The interpolation of the
word Merciorum, is therefore due to Hemming or
some other copyist anterior to him, and probably
resulted from some ignorant or knavish monk’s
