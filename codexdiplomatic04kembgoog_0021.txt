Χ INTRODUGTlON.

In nomine dominil or In nomine domini nostri
Ihesu Christi, Saluatoris! or Regnante domino
nostro! In nomine Trino divino! In nomine sanctae
et indiuidnae Trinitatis! In nomine Patris et Filii et
Spiritus sancti! etc. etc. These short sentences in
general do not offer· any tangihle points on which to
found an argument as to the authenticity of a charter,
but if omitted altogether they are presumptive
evidence either that the document is a forgery, or
that it has come down to us in a mutilated form.

ΙΙ. The Proem. The second member of an Anglo·
saxon charter is a general ohservation, somewhut
similar iu effect to the movent clause of a Norman
one. It usually states the virtue of charity, especially
to the Church3 or it expatiates on the nothingness of
earthly possessione, and the advantage of purchasiug
with them, heavenly treasures. Or it sets forth the
transitory nature of things temporal, and the uncer-
tainty of all human conditione, and impressas the
necessity of having formal recognitione of grants and
contracts. In many cases these proems contain
indirect references to canons of the chnrch3 some of
them are directly founded on texts of scripture,
which are sometimes quoted at length. As a general

rule it may he observed that before the tenth century
the proem is comparatively simple; that about that
time, the influence of the Byzantina court began to
be felt, and that from the latter half of that century,
pedantry and absurdity struggle for the mastery.
The forms which survive are for the most part
reducible under three great heads.

lst. That earthly goods are transitory, bnt things
eternal are abiding: hence that things transitory

ought to be freely given to purchase things
etemal.
