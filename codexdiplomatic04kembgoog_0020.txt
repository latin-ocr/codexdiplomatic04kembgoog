the class: as Savigny well observes ‘⁴ Whatever
nation they might belong to hy birth, their priestly
character made them belong to a new uotiua-fthe
clergy⁸ :” hence, both sor themselves and those whom
they could influence, they retained as much as
possible of their national forma, vin. the Roman.
The collection of Marculfus professed to embody
these for the Merovingian Franks; other collectione
have retained the precedents of the Carlovingian
princes3 the still older formularies of Cassiodorius
did the same sor the Ostrogoths in Italy. The Liber
Diurnus of the Church supplied similar patterns for
ecclesiastical instrumente, unmixed with national
peculiarities

A similar work might perhaps be compiled hom

’ the Anglosaxon charters, so regular and strict are

they inform: and as their authenticity seems capable
os being tested in some degree by such internal
evidence, it will he advisable to subject these forms
to a detailed examination. A Saxon charter pro-

perly so called aud distinguished from a will or the

record of a synodal decrec, consists os all or some of
the following porticus:

I. The Invocation. II. The Proem. ΙΙΙ. The
Grant. IV. The Sanction. V. Tthate. Vl.
The Teste.

And first of the Invocation. By this name Ι call
the short ejaculation which usually forms the first
. member of the document. These are very numerous
and various, and among them I find the following,
