XC IN'l'RODUO'l'lON.

rally to suspect a eonsciousness that that something
was in reality not worthy of belief.

Besides this, there is an unfortunate fatality about
these corroborations3 they are with hardly an ex·
ception taken from the chronicles, and generally
from such remarkable events as would be in every
man’s recollection who had read them. However
much our simpleminded forefathers may have con-
sidered them strong evidences of truth‚ to us they
can hardly appear in any light but directly the
contrary.

VI. The last formal part of a charter which it is
necessary for me to note are the Subscriptions or
Teste. The Roman law appears not to have re-
quired signatures3 the presence of the witnesses being
held to be sufficient to authenticate a document.
How lar this principle prevailed in the church I will
not take upon mysell to say: but in almost all
ecclesiastical instruments we find the witnesses sub·
scribing with their own hands. Althongh in the
early ages ol the church we find many prelates who
could not write their own names, it is probable that
the clergy as a body were generally placed in a
better position, as lar as this point goes, than the
laity: and various canons require the signatore
(subscriptiones) ol bishops to such solemn docu-
ments. The researches of diplomatists have estab-
lished tbe fact that many os the most powerful
princes ol the Teutonic tribes could not write at all,
but stamped their names upon their grants. Wibt-
raed's admission that he signed with his mark pro
ignorantia litterarum has been made somewhat more
os than it deserved: his expression is almost a
mmmmmmwmwmmm
to make his acknowledgment worth repeating so
