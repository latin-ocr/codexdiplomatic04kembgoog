Now Simeon's own dates for these events are,
Foundation by Aidan . 635, which -l- 240 = 875.
Β5591 of Cu’uberht . . 687, -l- 188 : 875.
Eardwulf's consecration 854, -Ι- 21 = 875.
firstdevantation . .793, ·l- 82 = 875.

By keeping this rule in view, wo obtain in nearly
every case 915 same results as ara gathered from
Simeon's other chronicle, the Chronicle of Mailros,
and the Annals of Hoveden. To apply this by way

. os farther illustration to what has been said of the

Dionysian tables: according to Simeon, Higbald
Bishop of Lindissarn died in the ninth year from the
sack os Lindisfarn by the Danes. suppose now
that Simeon had seen such a table as 915 following:

Dccxclll. Dani Lindisfam insulam uastant.

vii. id. Iun.

Dccxcllll.

Ducxcv.

Dccxcvl.

Dcuxcvll. ·
¹ Dccxcvlll.

Dccxclx.

Dccc.

Dcccl. Highaldus episcopus moritur. v111.lral.

Iun.

Now it is clear that wa can only have 5111115 wana
by counting both 793 and 801 as full years. For
the Danas sacked Lindisfarn on the 791 of June,
793, and Higbald died the 2591 of May, 801: but
from 915 791 os June, 793, to the 791 of June, 891,
are only eight full years; so that 915 2591 of May,
801, would in fact have fallen in 915 eighth‚ not ninth
year.

There scema, on 915 other hand, reason to think Α

that in processus time the regnal years were more
