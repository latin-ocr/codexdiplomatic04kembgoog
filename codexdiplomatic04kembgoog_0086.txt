sovereigns.

Secondly, that from various circumstances the
Auglosaxons stood in much nearer connexion with
Rome than with France, and in short in much
nearer connexion with Rome than France itself did
in the time cs AEthelhert the first. Consequently it
is the customs oi the Papal court that the Anglo-
saxon customs would probably resemble, much rather
than those oi some one or all of the Franlrish dis·
tricis.

It appears therefore that the uonintrcdnction os
the era of the incarnation into public documents in
Frauce atthis period is no sound argument against
its prevalenoe in Englaud.

The absence of this date in the original charters
of the seventh century which we possess has been
considered a good grourm for denying its prevalence
in Euglaud at that period. Το this conclusion, how·
ever, Ι must demur. Surcly itis too much to gc
about to prove a negative, and with such sleuder
means. There do not exist at most above two
original charters of the seventh century, aud it is a
’ strange abuse of logio to argue that because these
two charters dc not contain the date of the incarna-
tion, that date was unknown when they were written.
See what would hc the consequence of pushing this
argument to its conclusion. A large majority ol
AElfred’s and Ead weard the Confessor's charters are
undated3 supposing these to he the earliest we
possessed, we must upon the same grounds admit
that till 900 or 1066 the English had uo dates at all,
a conclusion which the facts themselves prove to he
eminently salse.

Having shown then a priori how probahle it is
