of the Soutbangles: and this he might justly do,
since the Marciana whose king he was, were the
most important os the English Angla tribes3 and the
Southangles‚ is ever separated in their government,
were an appanage of the reigning Mercian family:
Peada‚ Penda's son, was during his lather’s lifetime
king of the Middle and Southangles. Others add
indefinitely caeterarumque gentium in ciruuitu per-

undoubtedly of later growtb, smacks of the bombast
os Byzantium. The Kings of Marcia after (loen-

Kings of Kont, which was an appanage to Mercia in
the hands of chereti, Coenuuls’s brother, till 805,
became again an independent kingdom under Bal·
dred, and finally sank into an appanage sor the sons
and brothers of the Westsaxon kings. These latter
called themselves originally Kings of the Gewissas‚
their family tribe3 somewhat later, Kings of the
Westsaxons3 later still Kings os 'the Westsaxons
and men os Kent. After the union of nearly all
England in the person os Aebelstdn, this style was
in general abandoned for that ol Rex totius Albionis,
Rex et primicerius totius Brittanniae, or words of
similar import.

As we have scarcely any Nerthumbrian chartam,
a fact as strange as it is much to be lamented, we
can give no account whatever of the style adopted

that they caresully maintained the distinction be-
tween Deire and Bernicia, which has been unac-
countably overlooked by many historiens os Saxon

, England. The Kings of Essex called themselves

Reges Eastsexorum or Eastsaxonum as long as
