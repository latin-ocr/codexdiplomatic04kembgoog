When we consider what has been said of the
method of subscribing‚ and how improbable it is
that any of the witnesses either did or could write
his own name, it seems very remarkable that any
notice should ever have been taken of the circum-
stance, as in No. 43. My own explanation of this
anomaly is, that the imperitia scribendi was already
a casus provisus ²², and that there was a formulary
applicable to it; though it was never generally used
in England, because the case was universal, and
required no special treatment. We have it on record
that one at least of the Roman emperors could not
sign his name (Mabillon de Re dipl. ii. 22), charle-
magne notoriously could not; and as this ignoranco
must have been far more widely dispersed‚ it stands
to reason that some general provision must have
been made for the occurrence. As under the Roman
law the presence of certain officers was usual, the

, affixing of a cross before them was a sufficient sub-

stitute for the signature: and this, which may have
first led to the use os the sign, was adopted hy the
church. Mabillon has collected some instanoes of

bishops having made their mark, from ignorance‚
or from old age, irom sickness, or from wantos
sight. A larger and still more interesting collection
of instances is found in the notes 'to Marini Pap.

two others of laymen.
