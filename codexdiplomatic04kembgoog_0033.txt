stance ol a grant is recorded in a compressed and
narrative sorm3 though at the same time, sor the
greater authority, or to point out the particular
document alluded to, the names of the witnesses

As sar as these points go, the only possible test is

History knows little of the various reguli who within
their petty territories exercised the regal power3 and
