Now according to such a computation the year of
a king's accession would ,be considered his first year,
even though there might romain only a few weeks or
days till the aeth of December, when a new year of
Christ would begin. This however would be called
his second year, and so on. Now it is clear that ,
the regnal years and years of Christ cau only coin-
cide in the case where the king should happen to
come to the throne von the aeth of December: in
every other conceivable case, each strict regnal year
must fall in two years of Christ, and each year ol
Christ mnst extend over parts of two regnal years.
For the earliest times however this distinction does
not appear to have been observed.
Ι Many striking instances of the practice described
above might be given: and by way of illustration wc
may take the dates of Simeon ol Dnrham’s Historia
Dnnclmensis Ecclesiae. Simeon in giving these
dates always includes the year from which be starts;
whence arises the general rule that one less than the
number of years stated is to be added to the year
from which he starts, in order to get the year in
which he places any particolar event. For instance,
the year 875 is thus noted by him, in describing
