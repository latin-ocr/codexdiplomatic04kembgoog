The only one of these words which requires any
commentis Sigillum. The Norman charters are for
the most part granted under seal; those of the
Saxone never. Now as sigillum means a seal, and
datum sub sigillo is a Norman form, many persons
have imagined that the occurrence of the words
sigillum and sigillare in aSaxon charter is evidence
of iorgery. From what has been said it will be seen
that I do not hold this opinion to be accurate. The
word itself has various meanings3 that os a scal, iu
the Norman sense, is not even the most common os
them. It signifies, properly speaking, any sign or .
mark which one impressas, and was applied among
other things to the sign os the cross made in
baptism, in which sense it is borne out by Chryses-
tom's nse of the word ampuys. But a meaning by no
means unusual in the middle ages was that of a flag
or banner; and in this sense I believe it to be used
in these charters, an equivalent for labarum ‘and
vexillum, whenever it is not used as a mere diminu-
tive of signnm. That there was no notiou whatever
of a seal, will I think appear from the actual appli-
cation oi the word in the following examples:

1. cnm sigillo sanctae crucis. Edw. Conf. 1045.

2. hunc subscriptionis nostrae sigillum.
AE’dehed, 1001.

No doubt instances may be cited where it occurs
in the Norman sense, and from charters which are
not genuine. All I contend teristratae word oi
itself is not conclusive evidence of sorgery. Sub
sigillo is rather more suspicious; but even here it
may be a fair question, whether a transcriber of the
twelfth, thirteenth, or fourteenth centuries did not
substitute this well known phrase for the cnm sigillo
