version of Aethelberht oi Kent, in 598, and the
death of Ecgberht ol Wessex, in 838. ot these a
portion have been already printed in such works as
Reyner’s Apostolatus Benedictinorum in Anglia, the

Monasticon Anglicauum, Steven’s History oi Mo-
nasteries, Hearnc’s Textus Roffensis, Hearne’s Hem-
ming, Somner’s Antiquities of Canterbury, Widmore’s
History of Westminster Abbey, the published copies
ol Malmsbury and Ingulf, aud other voluminous and
rare compilatione. The difficulty of meeting with
'some of these works, and still more the inconveni-
ence of turning to them for the soattered charters ·
they contain, would have justified us sor repriuting
these documents, even had expericnce not forced
upon us the acknowledgment, ¹that the advantages to
be derived from their use are only to be obtained
from them when collected into oue body and chrono-
logically arranged. This arrangement alone fur-
nishes us with a complete induction, and complete
Ι mastery over the charters themselves as means to
, historical and legal ends. Very many, however,
have never hitherto appeared in print, and among
them arethe most important of the whole collection.
With the exception of about halt a dozen, to whose
originals we could not obtain acccsS, or ot which
'the originale have perished, every charter has been
carefully collated with the manuscript or manuscripts
in which it is preserved. There are, however, still a
few charters which belong to this period, and of
which, from unavoidable circumstances, Ι have as
yet not been able to obtain copies. Such are the
Sherborne charters, in the possession of Sir T. Phil·
lipps, one or two in the possession of the Earl of
Ilchester, and about halt a douen in the collection of
the Duke ol Buckingham, which last I have for the

present lost through the lamented death os his grace,
