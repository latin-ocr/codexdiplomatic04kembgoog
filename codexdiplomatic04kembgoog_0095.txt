strictly construed; viz. from the day of the king's
accession in one year of Christ to the same day in
the next year, and then a close calculation is neces-
sary in order to test the accuracy oi the document.
Unfortunately we are uot often sufficiently fumished
with the means os doing this, the exact time of the
year at which a king came to the throne being in a
large majority os cases unknown: so that our reason-
ing would be a circle, the time of the accession
being only to be ascertained'by a comparison os the
charters‚ and the authenticity of the charters depend-
ing pro tanto upon an accurate knowledge of the
time of the accession. This difficulty is felt more
particularly when we attempt to assign the year of
the incarnation to a charter which has only the date
of the regnal year. For instance, suppose we had a
charter dated in the third year oi Offa of Marcia: in
what year of our Lord should we place thist offa
we· know cameto the throne late in the year 757.
Is his third year to be reckoned above generally as
759: or is it to be taken to extend from late in 759
to late in 760t In short, to comprehend two or
three months of one, and nine or ten months of the
other; and in which portion is it to he placedl Itis
clear that we might easily err hero by a whole year
of Christ. Our only corrective is au accidental one,
arising from the dates of the bishops who may have
signed the charter‚ and it is very lar from being
complete.

I trust that such of my readers as may have
occasion to pursue historical researches for the iur-
therance of which these charters may be useful, will
feel that to enter completely upon this one point
would require almost as much space as can be
devoted to this whole preface, if not to the whole
collection; and that they will therefore content them·
