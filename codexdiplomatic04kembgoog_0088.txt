apograph3 for in this case it might be nemore than
a harmless addition of the copyist; and the charter
would be, on that account alone, no less trustworthy
than the letters of Gregory, which Beda had in a
similar manner interpolated.

This consideration is not altogether unimportant;

ferit does sometimes happen that charters have
been so interpolated as to appear full of the most
absurd anachronisms; whereas by placing them
fifteen, thirty, or even forty-iive years earlier or
later than the professed date, they become perfectly
consistent, and the anachronism vanishes. All that
we can say in such case is, that the copyist, finding
only the date of the indiction in the charter, had
miscalculated by fifteen, thirty, or forty-five years, in
attempting to add the year of the incarnation.
· The date of the indiction here referred to, which is
so frequently found in use in Anglosaxon and other
instrumente, was earlier adopted throughout Europe
than the era of the incarnation. The indictione are
cyclos of fifteen years, continually recommencing
after the fifteenth3 so that the indiction for 1842
being Xy, that for 1843 will be 1, for 1844 11, and so
on in succession till 1857, when the indiction will
again be nu. Tbese cycles are usually understood
to have come inte vogue about the year 237, but
they became the basis of a calculation which com-
prised a far earlier period, and according to which
Dionysius assigned the birth of our Lord to the
fourth indiction. 'The reason for the establishment
cf these dates is thus given by Beda:

Secundus ordo circuli decennoualis complectitur
indictiones xv annorum circuitu in sua semper
vestigia reduces, quas antiqua Romanorum industria
comperimus ad cauendum errorem, qui de tempori·
