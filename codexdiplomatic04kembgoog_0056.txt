Sao is the abbreviation of Sacu, litis, and naturally
was taken to denote the jurisdiction in litigious
suits. Why its possession was of importance need
certainly not be explained. But Sbc, which pro-
perly denotas the district comprehendcd under such
privileged jurisdiction, as Sbcmen, Sokmanni, deuotes
the persons subject to it, does not seem to be the

second word in this alliterative sentence. In⁴ the
earliest examples we far more frequently find soen
aud Sdcne than Sdc, and this I believe to be the
right phrase. Sbon is inquisitio, the preliminary and
initiative in Sacu, in other words the right of iuves-
tigating, necessary to and a part of power of holding

considered still more precisus, consequent upon that
jurisdiction,viz. the receiving of the mulot, or money-
