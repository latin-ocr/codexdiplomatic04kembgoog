famulus plebis dciv, a term which is recorded to
have had its origin in the humility of Gregory the
Great, but is well known to have remained as the
peculiar addition of the bishops of Rome, the haugh-
tiast hierarohs of whom history hath to tell. During
the tenth and eleventh centurias the rege sor fantastic
subscriptions worked even upon the titles os the
bishops, and we have every variety of phrase by
which their dignity could bo described, as episcopus
sacerdos, onustes, praelatns, catascopus, speculator
plebis dei, etc. etc. Prelates, between the time of
their election and consecration do not appear to
have adopted the continental stylo of vocotus, bnt
electus, which we yet retain: and instead of the
qualification etsi peccator, which, though common in
foreign diplomata, is almost unknown in our own,
wo have licet indignus.

Some consideratione of importance seem to arise
from the words made use of to describe the cross
itsell. The more usual form is signum crucis adposui
,or signo crucis confirmabi. But other words replace
signum, especially in the later charters. These
words are Agalma, Charactcr, Gabulum, Indicium,
Indiculum‚ Munimen, Patibulum, Sigillum, Signa-
culnm, Singrapha, Tauma, Testndo, Titulum, Tripu-
. dium, Triumphum, Tropheum, Uexillum, Uirtus:
and itis possible that there may be yet others.
Some of these words apparently refer to the abstract
power or holincss of the sign, as Munimen, Tauma
(tropa), Triumphum, Uirtus. Others to the form, as
Gabulum, Patibulum, Tripudium (qucrcvc); others
again to the legend of Constantino and his banner,

, with its εν roura νικης to which last head seem to

belong Sigillum, Tropheum, Uexillum.
