the MSS. of the twelfth and following century, the
errors continually committed in transcribing them,
and the confusion made in them hythe Norman
chroniclers. Still it is a very singular fact, if the
conclusion which naturally follows from this be
admitted, viz. that the Normans found these rights
in force here, that there should be so little evidence
of their existence fumished by the charters them-
selves. They were quite as much matters of grant
before the conquest as after3 some of them were
valuable enough to be anxiously recorded3 yet there
‚ is no record of them earlier than the time of the
Confessor, save in a charter of Eadghr which I can-
not look upon as genuine.

The words used to express them belong to the
Anglosaxons, and are unknown to the Norman law,
as such: when latinized, they plainly presuppose
Saxon and not Norman originuls. From the Saxone
then they came ; and the only question is, were they
in use before the conquest, or were they introduced
after the conquest, to express new relations caused
by the conquest itself; and if so, why were English
terms selected to denote themf

It seems to me that there is reason to believe that
such rights did exist previous to the conquest.
Some of them we can prove to have existed3 and
this fact makes it probable that the rest did so. I
account for the rare mention of them in the one
case, by the supposition that they were so inherent ·
in the possession of land, as not to require particu-
larization3 but that under the N ormans when every
right and privilege must be struggled for, and the
consequences of the Norman love of litigation were
bitterly felt, it became matter of necessity to have

them*d not only tacitly recognized, but solemnly
recor ed.
