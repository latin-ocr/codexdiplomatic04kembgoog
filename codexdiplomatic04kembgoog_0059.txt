the regalia of the Empire‚ of the Italian and Frankish
kingdoms, and why not therefore of the Anglosaxons

the King might, whenever he chose, relinquish the

say that Ι doubt the authenticity of many of the
charters in which these exemptionsarefound3 though
the unquestionable fact os such exemptions having
been made at the same period by the Frankish princes,
makes it probable that such existed here, and indeed
the first example adduced below is of unquestionable
authenticity.

The second case seems equally clear. All private
rights possessed by the King may be delegated, and
this among them3 even as the exemptiou from tithing
by the prince in the case of church lands, laid the
foundation of a claim to tithe on the part of the
church itseli. The examples are not numerous, but
still I think decisive on the point, inasmuch as Ι
look upon them as genuine. Isuhjoin all the ex-
