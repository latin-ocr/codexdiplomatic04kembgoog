The next thing to privileges conferred‚ are immu-
nities from burthens lying upon the land in general;
and these I shall take in order immediately3 but
before I proceed to give examples of such immuni-
ties, it is necessary to advert to other forms which
in the later period of the Anglosaxon power were
constantly introduced into the instrumente of the
KingS, as conferring privileges of a most importent
character. These comprise the words so generally
found in the charters of the first Norman Kings, but,
so far as I know, not occurring in any authentic
Sarion document previous to the time ol Eddweard
the Confessor. I allude especially to the well known
formulary sac -y soc, on strande Ἰ on streme,on wude
Ἰ an feld, grithbrice, burhbrice, hundred setena, adhas
⁴yordelas, calle hordas hovenertbin et binnethacre,
infangethef, utfangethes, flemenefertbe, hamsocne, toll
-y team, etc. etc.

It is not to be denied that at a comparatively
early period ol the Nomen occupatior these words
were not entirely intelligible to the conquerere ¹⁰:
witness the many attempta at explanation given in

¹⁰ The Normans could noteven coplas cophe ,· and we havetrans-
' rpell the worde; hence they write formed the saxon potpeallepap
griderbryce, friderbryce for grid· (ie.potboilere,householdere,men
bryee, frlahryce, their own con· who keep up a lire in their house)
baction sor der bearing a distant into Potroullopere. There are many
resemblance to the Saxou b. small glossarios ol these words in
Malmsbury speaks ol calle hordas various MSS. ol the xiith cen-
buiam corderam and ben corde· tury3 and some Norman charters
ram, meaning ealle bordae bufan which, while they confirm the
eordan 7 binnan eorem. Bya privileger,frankly etate thatthey
similar error ol the eye Montes· do not know the meaning ol the
quieu was led to call the Saron words they are confirming.
