tion being thus taken to commence upon tho same
day. Tho same result is obtained by examining tho
dates oi Pope Gregory's letters, recorded by Beda;
all of which are consistent and accurate if the indic-
tions he taken to commoneo with the year, but all of
which mnst be dated one year later if the indictions
were rechoned from tho 24th of September, in which
caso they would all fall a year later than tho his-
torical truth demands, and Bcdo himself understood
the case.

The Concurrents, honere, Epacts, Decennovalos
and other similar dates are sometimes introduced
into Saxon charters, especially those oi later date.
The importaoco of these as tests is well known3 and
as I heve nothing to say respecting them but what is
familiar to all persons conversant with diplomacy,
and no discrepaucy to note in the Anglosaxon use
of them, Ι will pass on at once to a somewhat
intricate braneh os my subject, the Regnoi years of
the Kings.

Though these aro far from uncommon in the chro-
nicles and charters, tho mode of calculating them is
by no means clear. Without presuming to decide
positively upon a subject of so much difficulty, Ι
will throw out a suggestion which perhaps may lead
hereafter to a satisfactory conclusion. It seems to
me that at various periods these dates were rechoned
in two distinct ways: at the earlier period thore
existed o multitude of Dionysian nubles, in the mar-
gins of which events were recorded opposite to the
year in which thoy occurred: for example,
