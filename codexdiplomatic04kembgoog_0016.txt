had attached themselves personally to a highborn
chiestain, olaiming deen’s blood, and therefore
kingly-stood in no new relation in the country of
which they took possession. They only formed a
noble class, aud shared a portion of the whole land
subdued¹. But lands both he and they undoubtedly
did possess 3 andthis very fact of possession neces-
sarily supposes the means and forms of transfor,
and the gradual establishment os a system of law, '
based on that possession and transfer.

Itis highly probable that the means by which this
was affected among the Anglosaxons, were at first
similar in every respect to those by which the same
results were provided for on the continent. The
hrisowairpis or stipulatio, the cdrdoe crride or traditio
cespitis of the Franks had doubtless corresponding
symbols in this country. For these symbolical forms
were based upon that religious belief which, in all
its essential features at least, was common both to
the peoples of Scandinavia and all the Teutonic
tribes of Germany. The multitude of methods by
which, in later times, livery of seisin might be given,
nay even the particular customs of various mauors,
seem to have had their origin in these ancient
provisions os the Teutonic law2.

It must not he forgotten that we have uo trust·
worthy record of any single event os English history,
previous to the arrival of Augustine (A. n. 597).
