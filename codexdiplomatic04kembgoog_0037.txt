Offa of Essex bad been long forgotten, and vves
never powerful enough to be much worth remem-
bering: it was otherwise with Oileos Mercia But
to my eyes the very error into which these copyists
have fallen is evidence pro tento of the authenticity
of thet which they copied.

Another cherter oi the same prince has been
called in question because he is styled in it Rex
orientalium Anglorum, while it should have been
orientalium Saxonum. The charter is no doubt a

forgery3 but still the nisnomer does not seem to me
to be alone evidence that it is so: this, taken alone,
proves to my mind nothing more than that the copy
we possess was interpolated at a period when the
separate existence os Essex es a kingdom hed eeased
to be remcmbered, but when that of Easteuglia had

not.

The Chartularies of Abingdon tirrnish us with au
interesting example os this kind os error, and at the
same time with a warning not to decide rasbly. One
os these Ms. Cott Claud. c. ix. gives a charter oi
Aeailbald of Mercia and Aeeilhenrd oi Wessex.
The second chartulary MS. Cott. Claud. Β. vi. gives
the seme charter, with the same witnesses, excepting
Aeailheard, end attributes it to Aeaelbald of ,
Wessex, Aeeelwulf’s successor, a prince who reigned
more thau a century later. This discrepancy serves
to show that the compilers os both chartulariee had
read, though only one had understood, the seme
original.

It seems then that in this case, our only tests are
the usual ones ol history, but that allowance must
be made ior the ignorance oi copyists end compilers.
In charters professing to be originale, this is oi
course excluded: but even here some ellowances are
