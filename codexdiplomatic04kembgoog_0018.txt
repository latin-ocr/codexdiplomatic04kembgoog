this was no new arrangement, appear to me to be
applicahle to the whole period between Augustine
and Beda. For the extreme importance attached to
the destmction of all remnants of heathendom, to
which the symbolic transfers more especially be-
longed, rendered it from the very first necessary to
substitute for them such forms as the Church had
sanctioned3 since in all times, the possession and
transfer of land become one of the deepest founda-
tions ol the whole social polity.

I therefore see no reason to doubt that land was
transferred hy documentary forms, either with or

without symbolic forms ⁵, from the very first introduc·

business is now to investigate wherein those forms
consisted.

Throughout Europe the documentary dispositions
of the Latins prevailed. The conquerors readily
adopted such portions of the law of the conquered,
as applied to those new relations of lise which the ·
conquest itself had created, ond those social wants
which had not been provided for in their own un-
written, ’ customary law. The formal study ol the
