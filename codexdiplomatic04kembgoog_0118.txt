attributions were the same; and their principle, and
as it were theory, differs in nothing from those of the
other Gemens. It is however only in their judicial
capacity that we have to consider them.

It was determined in the year 673, at a synod
presided over by Hlo'cheri the sovereign ol Kent,
and probably attended by all the English bishopS,
that these synods or councils should be held twice in
every year, and that one of these mectings should
always take place cn the first ol August at Closesho;
the place and time ot' the other being probably lest to
be determined by circumstances. Accordingly we
find a majority of these instruments dated from
Clclesh0; the most numerous of the rest being
passed nt eealchys. That these councils were
legislative bodies we may sec by the collectione of
laws passed in them, not only for the churcb‚ but the
laity; and a passage already cited (p. lxxiii) proves
that they were also courts of justice. By a council
holdcn in 816, it was ordered that thel judgmeuts
given by such courts should be enrolled3 aud to
this we owc the valuable records which we still
possess.

Generally speaking, these documeuts do not differ
in form from the chartcrs or grants of individuals‚
except in a very natural preponderanoe ol that
proem which points out the necessity of committing
solemn decisions to writiug. But sometimes the
whole progress of a suit is detailcd in a narrative ·
form, and the pleadings on both sides, is we may
call them so, as well as the judgement, are placed
upon the record. The importance of these it is
unnecessary to dilate upon, and this is not the place
to enter upon the details which they ¹have preserved

to us. The same observations apply to the records '

of suits in the county court.
