Roman time oi celebrating Easter. Now the disputes
on this subject between the Western ond Eastern
churcbes ¹had already led to the composition of
elaborate tables, accurately deliniog the recurring
dates upon the calculation of which the paschal
period depended²⁶. Amongst these the most cele-
brated are those of Dionysius, who about the year
526 put sortb his complete series oi circles, intro-
ducing for the first time the years of the incarnation.

. It will be difficolt to believe that these tables, so

important for the solution oi the great controversy, ·
were not brought to Britain by Angustine3 and still
more difficolt to believe that he did not engerly seiza
the opportunity to substitute the venerable era they
contained for any other that he might find here
established.

These who argue that the era os the incarnation
was not introduced into England till the time of
Beda, appear to me to bave no sound grounds sor
their belief. One solitary passage that has been
pressed into their service has been so merely from a
misunderstanding of its contents. It is necessary
to examine it somewhat more closely, in order to
show how completely it proves the contrary of what
is usually supposed. It occurs in the tract De
Natura Rerum, in a place where Beda is arguing
as to the number of years which the Saviour spent
upon carth, and where he thus avails himself of the
authority of the Roman choreb:
