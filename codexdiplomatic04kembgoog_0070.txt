One of the most important immunities recorded in
these charters is exemption from forfeiture. Itis
well known that various crimes ot' a deeper die were
followed by escheat of the lands to the king, the
church‚ or the lord, as the case might be. I shall
not refer to those clauses of the Anglosaxon codes
which relate to this subject, but rather cite one or
two passages, showing in what manner and under
what circumstances the law was applied. The first
of these is not dated, but-falls somewhere about the
time of Edward the elder, thetis in the first quarter
os the tenth century. A man had been guilty ol
theft, and was convicted3 his chattels escheated
to his lord the king3 his ldnland reverted to the
grantor.

The next passage dates lrom about the middle of
the same century (963-975), and is equally interest-
ing and important. A woman and her son had been
convicted of aiming at the life oi a nobleman‚ by
means of witchcraft and the sticking pins into a
waxen image. The woman was condemned to death
and executed hy drowning at London Bridge3 the
son escaped and became an outlaw3 the land
